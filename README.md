# Networks-and-System-Security
This repository contains all the assignments and the project of the course SIL765 : Networks and System Security

## Assignment 1 :  
### Cryptanalysis of Substitution Cipher
In this assignment the Hill Climbing algorithm is implemented to decrypt the cipher text encrypted using substitution cipher. The scores of the quadgrams in the text are used as a score metric in the hill climbing algorithm (the scores of various quadgrams are written in the 'english_quadgrams.txt' file. The 'dict.json' file is the contains english dictionary.

## Assignment 2 :  
### Evaluating cryptographic primitives
In the assignment the following cryptographic algorithms provided by python are used and their performance is analysed :
* AES-128-CBC-ENC 
* AES-128-CBC-DEC
* AES-128-CTR-ENC
* AES-128-CTR-DEC
* RSA-2048-ENC
* RSA-2048-DEC
* AES-128-CMAC-GEN
* AES-128-CMAC-VRF
* SHA3-256-HMAC-GEN
* SHA3-256-HMAC-VRF
* RSA-2048-SHA3-256-SIG-GEN
* RSA-2048-SHA3-256-SIG-VRF
* ECDSA-256-SHA3-256-SIG-GEN 
* ECDSA-256-SHA3-256-SIG-VRF
